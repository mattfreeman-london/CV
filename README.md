# Matt Freeman

I'm a Makers Academy graduate, changing careers after working in Customer Services. I want to work in tech to challenge myself, learn new skills, and create. I graduated from the Makers Bootcamp in London in January 2020 having learned Javascript, Ruby and Python. We also were taught lightweight Agile methods, such as Scrum. My goal is to work on projects that make a difference to usersâ€™ lives, and to write accessible, bug-free code.

### Utility Warehouse (May 2013 - Sept 2019)

*Customer Services Advisor*

Which? Magazine multi-award winning utility company, working with incoming calls and emails to help customers with moving house. Required a variety of knowledge of energy systems, home phone & broadband installation and trouble-shooting, and managing expectations. Worked with long-standing customers who had years of experience with the company, and expected the best service.

### BPP Professional Education (June 2007 - October 2012)

*Customer Services Advisor*

Helping companies book their employees on training courses, focusing on Accountancy training. Working under pressure taking incoming calls, as spaces would rapidly fill up. Managing off-the-cuff requests to adjust dates and locations, and working with repeat clients spending thousands of pounds a year.

### Professional Actor

After leaving University, but before getting into full-time office work I was a professional actor. I performed at the Edinburgh Fringe, in Theatre in Education projects and on touring theatrical productions. I was delighted to play the title role in Terry Pratchett's *Eric!* in York. I gained huge confidence in speaking in front of people, communicating, and working with children.

### University of Plymouth (Sept 1997 to June 2000)

*Theatre and Performance Studies(BA Hons)*

### Skills

*Attention to detail*
- In my role in Customer Services I excelled at being able to spot the small details that cause problems, and how to fix them. This would often mean spending time finding the root cause, rather than just addressing a surface complaint. This saved a lot of time in solving their issue in the long run, and reduced repeat contacts with the company. For example - finding that the original reason that a customer's broadband speed was slower than expected was to do with how their order had been originally placed, rather than a technical issue with their connection. We frequently had a lot of pressure to work quickly, so I also needed time-management and prioritisation skills in order to help manage the queue.

*Ability to communicate with people of all knowledge levels*
- My previous career involved working with everyone from managers and directors at work, to customers with little or no understanding of how their request translated into what we could do. I had to be able to effectively communicate and translate between different knowledge levels, to help the customer to understand what had happened and to make sure I could use appropriate technical terms within the workplace. With a customer on the phone, often I had to rapidly switch between different styles of language if I put them on hold. Swift, clear communication was absolutely vital to deliver the best experience. I excel in a fast-moving environment.

*Rapid decision making & an ability to change my mind*
- My major hobby is playing modern board games. This teaches an essential skill: constantly having to make decisions based on an ever-changing state of play. Part of being a good player is not holding up the game, so I learnt to make a decision and live with the consequences. If the situation changes, or if I'm in error, I'm able to admit to it, move on, and take a more appropriate action. I always treat this as a chance to learn something new.

### Hobbies
I'm an avid board gamer and role-player. I'm presently writing a Live Action Role-Playing game in a team of four writers, to be played in 2023. The game is designed for around 70-80 players, running over a whole weekend. To create the game, I'm coordinating with the rest of the team who are based in different cities in the UK. We're using online tools such as Trello and Google Docs as well as meeting face-to-face to organise the behemoth.
Board gaming has also helped me develop good risk-management, decision making, and short- and long-term planning.
