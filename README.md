Notes from Tech CV workshop (to be removed asap):

Be confident! Makers has a long track record of delivering new developers with high EQ, workrate, knowledge etc. 

Get a good CV, but it doesn't have to be amazing. However, the key is getting yourself out to people over having something that took you two weeks to do. Likely that your GitHub CV will be a main point of call. GitHub CV can be longer, so long as it doesn't waffle. :D

Actual CV should all fit on one page. https://enhancv.com/ is a good place to look for this. Write in simple English, communicate clearly - make the recruiters job easy! It probably won't all be read. 

If they read the first paragraph and nothing else, it should be enough to tempt them for an interview. YOU'RE A FULL STACK DEVELOPER, CLAIM IT. No need to sell Makers. Show something of your technical help - what do you love, what hooked you? Mention the blog. 

There's a big list of tech skills we've been exposed to - put them all down!

LIST 3-5 PROJECTS MINIMUM, as the second thing on the list. Show it, rather than list it. Talk about the team experience, what the code does (even if you didn't code all of it). 

Skills - the skills you list are less important than the examples you use to back it up. Maybe not team player or great communicator (these are the most common things to put). Mix up technical examples with things from other areas in your life. 

Experience - doesn't have to be too full (it's only useful if it's relevant). Leadership, automation, project management. Account for your years, don't leave gaps. Education - OK to start at university. 

Add a few hobbies, the most interesting ones not the generic ones. 

## Matt Freeman

I'm a developer-in-training with a lot of life experience, changing careers after working in Customer Services. Working through the Makers Bootcamp in London on an intensive course to bring me up to date with excellent working practices, such as Agile, and learning different languages. The goal is to work on projects that make a difference to the users by making sure they're bug-free and accessible to all.

## Skills

## Attention to detail
- in my role in Customer Services I excelled at being able to spot the small details that had caused a problem, and how to fix them. This would often mean spending time reading through the customer's file, going back as far as I needed to find the root cause, rather than just addressing a surface complaint. For example - finding that the original reason that a customer's broadband speed was slower than expected was to do with how their order had been originally placed two months ago, rather than a technical issue with their connection. This saved a lot of time in solving their issue, and helped the customer avoid a long conversation with our technical help team. 

## Ability to communicate with people of all knowledge levels
- my previous career involved working with everyone from managers and directors at work, to customers with little or no understanding of how their request translated into what we could do. I had to be able to effectively communicate and translate between different knowledge levels, to help the customer to understand what had happened and to make sure I could use appropriate technical terms within the workplace. With a customer on the phone, often I had to rapidly switch between different styles of language if I put them on hold. Swift, clear communication was absolutey vital to deliver the best experience. 

### Rapid decision making & an ability to change my mind
- my major hobby is playing modern board games. This teaches an essential skill, in that you're constantly having to make decisions based on an ever-changing state of play. Part of being a good player is not holding up the game, so I learnt to make a decision and live with the consequences. If the situation changes, or if I'm in error, I'm able to admit to it, move on, and take a more appropriate action. I always treat this as a chance to learn something new.

## Hobbies

As mentioned above, I'm an avid board gamer and role-player. I'm presently writing a Live Action role-playing game in a team of 5, to run in 2022 or 2023. This is designed for around 70-80 players, running over a weekend. Co-ordinating with the rest of the team who are based in different cities in the UK, so using online communication and project management tools as well as meeting face-to-face.
