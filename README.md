# Matt Freeman

I'm a developer-in-training with a lot of life experience, changing careers after working in Customer Services. Graduated from the Makers Bootcamp in London in January 2020 on an intensive course to bring me up to date with excellent working practices, such as Agile, and learning different languages. The goal is to work on projects that make a difference to the users by making sure they're bug-free and accessible to all.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
- in my role in Customer Services I excelled at being able to spot the small details that had caused a problem, and how to fix them. This would often mean spending time reading through the customer's file, going back as far as I needed to find the root cause, rather than just addressing a surface complaint. For example - finding that the original reason that a customer's broadband speed was slower than expected was to do with how their order had been originally placed two months ago, rather than a technical issue with their connection. This saved a lot of time in solving their issue, and helped the customer avoid a long conversation with our technical help team. 

#### Ability to communicate with people of all knowledge levels
- my previous career involved working with everyone from managers and directors at work, to customers with little or no understanding of how their request translated into what we could do. I had to be able to effectively communicate and translate between different knowledge levels, to help the customer to understand what had happened and to make sure I could use appropriate technical terms within the workplace. With a customer on the phone, often I had to rapidly switch between different styles of language if I put them on hold. Swift, clear communication was absolutey vital to deliver the best experience. 

#### Rapid decision making & an ability to change my mind
- my major hobby is playing modern board games. This teaches an essential skill, in that you're constantly having to make decisions based on an ever-changing state of play. Part of being a good player is not holding up the game, so I learnt to make a decision and live with the consequences. If the situation changes, or if I'm in error, I'm able to admit to it, move on, and take a more appropriate action. I always treat this as a chance to learn something new.
